# Welcome to compose_adaptive_scaffold

The aim of this repository is to make writing Jetpack Compose apps that support large screens and foldables a breeze. 
The use case is inspired by the Flutter package [flutter_adaptive_scaffold](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_adaptive_scaffold).
For now the `AdaptiveScaffold()` composable is no library (but part of a demo app), but this will change soon, once I feel the API has become somewhat stable.
I also intend to make the library available via Maven Central.
